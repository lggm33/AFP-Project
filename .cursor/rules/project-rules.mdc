Always verify the project structure before any suggestion or code change and referer to [CONTEXTO_PROYECTO.md](mdc:CONTEXTO_PROYECTO.md)
In any change, update this file. 
To start the app we always should use ./start.sh
When I ask anything, do not create the code inmediatamente in the chat, just give a logic example and wait if I want to implement something or not. 
All de comments and code must be in english but you should response in Spanish in the chat.
If you find comments in Spanish, you should translate them to english
All the scripts created by you for testing o debbing should be created in the script carpet
If you need to make changes to the database you can use psql:  DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://afp_user:afp_password@localhost:5432/afp_db"
