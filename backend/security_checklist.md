# üîê OAuth Token Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED SECURITY MEASURES

### **1. Token Encryption at Rest**
- [x] Tokens encrypted using Fernet (AES 128)
- [x] Encryption key stored in environment variables
- [x] Key rotation capability implemented
- [x] Decryption only when needed

### **2. Access Control & Auditing**
- [x] All token access logged with IP, timestamp, user agent
- [x] Suspicious activity detection
- [x] Failed access attempt monitoring
- [x] Security reports generation

### **3. Token Lifecycle Management**
- [x] Automatic token refresh
- [x] Token expiration enforcement
- [x] Secure token revocation
- [x] Cleanup of expired tokens

### **4. Network Security**
- [x] HTTPS only in production
- [x] Secure cookie settings
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Rate limiting on API endpoints

## üö® PRODUCTION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

### **Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
# Critical: OAuth token encryption key
OAUTH_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_key_here

# Database encryption at rest
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION=enabled

# Secure session configuration
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
```

### **Infrastructure Security:**
```bash
# Database security
- Enable encryption at rest
- Regular backup encryption
- Access logging enabled
- Network isolation

# Application security
- WAF protection
- DDoS protection
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Security headers
```

### **Monitoring & Alerts:**
```bash
# Set up alerts for:
- Multiple failed token access attempts
- Unusual IP addresses accessing tokens
- Token access outside business hours
- Excessive API calls to external services
```

## üìä RISK ASSESSMENT

### **HIGH RISK - REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:**
- [ ] Production encryption key management
- [ ] Database backup security
- [ ] Access logging to SIEM
- [ ] Incident response plan

### **MEDIUM RISK - MONITOR CLOSELY:**
- [ ] Token rotation schedule
- [ ] User permission audits
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Security scanning

### **LOW RISK - PERIODIC REVIEW:**
- [ ] Log retention policies
- [ ] Code security reviews
- [ ] Dependency updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## üéØ COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### **GDPR Compliance:**
- [x] Data minimization principle applied
- [x] Explicit user consent for token storage
- [x] Right to data deletion implemented
- [x] Audit trail for data access

### **SOC 2 Considerations:**
- [x] Access controls documented
- [x] Security monitoring in place
- [x] Incident response procedures
- [x] Regular security reviews

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRODUCTION

1. **Use Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**
   - AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault
   - Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key protection

2. **Implement Zero-Trust Architecture**
   - No implicit trust for internal services
   - Verify every request independently

3. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Penetration testing quarterly
   - Code security reviews monthly
   - Dependency vulnerability scans weekly

4. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**
   - Encrypted backups with separate keys
   - Regular restore testing
   - Geographic backup distribution
